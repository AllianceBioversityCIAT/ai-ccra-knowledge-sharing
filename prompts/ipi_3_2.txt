# Role & Task Definition:
You are tasked with generating the narrative text for IPI 3.2: Gender-smart climate information services and gender-smart climate-smart agriculture technologies reaching women through customized programs targeting their interests (Number) â€‹
 
## Objective:
Your goal is to craft a cohesive, structured, and data-driven narrative that highlights about "Gender-smart climate information services and gender-smart climate-smart agriculture technologies reaching women through customized programs targeting their interests (Number) "
---
Having into account this meausures to put in the Overall Numerical Summary:
[Total Target] = 20
[Total_Achieved] = 28


[Percentage] = Calculate(28/20)

## You have two JSON data sources available:
### IPI_3.2_Contributions.json :
Contains data on the achievements and contributions of various clusters under IPI 3.2: Gender-smart climate information services and gender-smart climate-smart agriculture technologies reaching women through customized programs targeting their interests (Number) . Each entry includes:
        Cluster (Region or Thematic Area)
        Targeted number of partners (Target_year_by_PMC)
        Actual number of partners achieved (End_year_achieved)
        Achieved_narrative: A detailed explanation of how CIS and CSA access has improved, including new partnerships, policy changes, training      programs, digital tools, and innovations.
### IPI_3.2_Additional_question.json:
Note: Number and name the  CIS/CSA technologies expected to be reported by this year end. After each technology, name the pathway expected to be used for dissemination/making technologies  accessible (if this last information is not provided the technology will not be counted against the target) (e.g. 2 CSAs: [1] Drought- and flood-tolerant rice varieties and 'Smart Valleys' are being made accessible in farmer field days and capacity building for farmer organizations)

## Introduction/Overview:
    
Clearly state the indicator and its purpose.
## Overall Numerical Summary:
    
Provide a narrative that includes the overall target, the overall achieved number, and the achievement  percentage (e.g., "By the end of 2024,    AICCRA targeted the of [Total Target]  for all cluster) partners/stakeholders and reached [Total_Achieved], achieving [Percentage]% of the target."). This information will be extracted from the IPI_3.2_Contributions.json.


## Cluster-Level Achievements:
Do not group clusters together. Each cluster must be presented in its own section/paragraph. Create separate sections for each of the following clusters:



Senegal (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved (from IPI_3.2_Contributions.json in the narrative)
Ghana (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved (from IPI_3.2_Contributions.json in the narrative) 
Zambia (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved (from IPI_3.2_Contributions.json in the narrative)
Mali (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved (from IPI_3.2_Contributions.json in the narrative)
Kenya (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved (from IPI_3.2_Contributions.json in the narrative)
Ethiopia (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved (from IPI_3.2_Contributions.json in the narrative)
EA (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved (from IPI_3.2_Contributions.json in the narrative)
WA (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved (from IPI_3.2_Contributions.json in the narrative)

 

For each cluster Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative (don't summarise the thematics clusters), use the corresponding [Achieved_narrative] from PDO1_Contributions.json and put the [End_year_achieved] (Ensure put the number for each cluster, Kenya Senegal, Ethiopia, Ghana,
Mali, Zambia). Extract by cluster the insights from the IPI_3.2_Additional_question.json filtering by Cluster que column :
Note: Number and name the  CIS/CSA technologies expected to be reported by this year end. After each technology, name the pathway expected to be used for dissemination/making technologies  accessible (if this last information is not provided the technology will not be counted against the target) (e.g. 2 CSAs: [1] Drought- and flood-tolerant rice varieties and 'Smart Valleys' are being made accessible in farmer field days and capacity building for farmer organizations)

# Conclusion:
Generate a narrative how the overall achievements and the separate, detailed cluster-level successes demonstrate AICCRA's effectiveness in expanding access to enhanced CIS and CSA technologies and in strengthening climate resilience in agriculture with based of each achieved_narrative.
# Important:
- Don't summarise of all, give me the all relevant details of each cluster in the IPI 3.2
- Do not combine or group clusters into one summary. Each cluster (2) must have its own clearly delineated section.
- The final output should be a single cohesive text in plain language, written in a formal and professional tone suitable for submission to the World Bank.
- Don't reference to the sources in the output.
- Ensure you put the following sections:
    - Introduction/Overview:
    - Overall Numerical Summary:
    - Cluster-Level Achievements
