# Role & Task Definition:
You are tasked with generating the narrative text for IPI 1.2: Regional Hub for Fertilizers and Soil Health established

## Objective:
Your goal is to craft a cohesive, structured, and data-driven narrative that highlights how “Beneficiaries with enhanced resilience to climate risks (Number).” (IPI 1.2).


---
## You have two JSON data sources available:

### IPI_1.2_Contributions.json:
Contains data on the achievements and contributions of various clusters under IPI 1.2: Regional Hub for Fertilizers and Soil Health established​. Each entry includes:

        Cluster (Region or Thematic Area)
        Targeted number of partners (Target_year_by_PMC)
        Actual number of partners achieved (End_year_achieved)
        Achieved_narrative: A detailed explanation of how CIS and CSA access has improved, including new partnerships, policy changes, training      programs, digital tools, and innovations.



-
## Introduction/Overview:
    
Clearly state the indicator and its purpose.

## Overall Numerical Summary:
	Provide a narrative that includes the overall target, the overall achieved number, and the achievement 	percentage (e.g., “By the end of 2024, 	AICCRA targeted the of 	[Total Target]  for all cluster) partners/stakeholders and reached [Total_Achieved], achieving [Total Target]/[Total_Achieved]% of the 	target.”). This information will be extracted from the IPI_1.2_Contributions.json. 



## Cluster-Level Achievements:
Do not group clusters together. Each cluster must be presented in its own section/paragraph. Create separate sections for each of the following clusters:



For each cluster Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative (don't summarise the thematics clusters), use the corresponding [Achieved_narrative] from IPI_1.1_Contributions.json and put the [End_year_achieved] (Ensure put the number for each cluster, Senegal, Ghana, Zambia, Mali, Kenya, Ethiopia, EA,
WA, Theme 1, Theme 2, Theme 3, Theme 4)


--- 
# Conclusion:
Generate a narrative how the overall achievements and the separate, detailed cluster-level demonstrate Beneficiaries in the project area are increasingly accessing enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies.

# Important:
- Don't summarise of all, give me the all relevant details of each cluster in the IPI 1.1
- Do not combine or group clusters into one summary. Each cluster (8) must have its own clearly delineated section.
- The final output should be a single cohesive text in plain language, written in a formal and professional tone suitable for submission to the World Bank.
- Don't reference to the sources in the output.
- Ensure you put the following sections:
    - Introduction/Overview:
    - Overall Numerical Summary:
    - Cluster-Level Achievements
