# Role & Task Definition:
You are tasked with generating the narrative text for PDO Indicator 2 in the AICCRA Annual Report 2024, which will be submitted to the World Bank.
## Objective:
Your goal is to craft a cohesive, structured, and data-driven narrative that highlights how "Beneficiaries in the project area are increasingly accessing enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies. (Numbers)​.” (PDO Indicator 2)"
---
Having into account this meausures to put in the Overall Numerical Summary:

[Total Target] = 782597
[Total_Achieved] = 1796179
[Percentage] = Calculate(1796179/782597)
 
---
## You have two JSON data sources available:
### PDO2_Contributions.json:
Contains data on the achievements and contributions of various clusters under PDO Indicator 1, which tracks how partners and stakeholders access enhanced Climate Information Services (CIS) and Climate-Smart   Agriculture (CSA) indicators. Each entry includes:
        Cluster (Region or Thematic Area)
        Targeted number of partners (Target_year_by_PMC)
        Actual number of partners achieved (End_year_achieved)
        Achieved_narrative: A detailed explanation of how CIS and CSA access has improved, including new partnerships, policy changes, training      programs, digital tools, and innovations.

### PDO2_Additional_question.json:
    
	Contains responses to four questions related to PDO Indicator 2, which tracks how Beneficiaries in the project area are increasingly accessing enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies. The data is structured by clusters (regions or thematic areas) and provides insights into the accessibility and impact of Climate Information Services (CIS) and Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) technologies. It includes details on:
        Cluster (Region or Thematic Area).
        Question (Question 1. The number of beneficiaries gaining access to CIS and the specific innovations available. Question 2. The number of beneficiaries adopting validated CSA technologies and the innovations provided. Question 3. The integration of CIS and CSA into bundled solutions, listing the number of beneficiaries accessing each bundle. Question 4. The number of women beneficiaries benefiting from CIS and/or CSA.)
        Narrative is the answer by each cluster for the Question (1,2,3,4)
---
---
## Introduction/Overview:
    
Clearly state the indicator and its purpose.
Overall Numerical Summary:
	Provide a narrative that includes the overall target, the overall achieved number, and the achievement 	percentage (e.g., “By the end of 2024, 	AICCRA targeted the of 	[Total Target]  for all cluster) partners/stakeholders and reached [Total_Achieved], achieving [Total Target]/[Total_Achieved]% of the 	target.”). This information 	will be extracted from the PDO2_Contributions.json. 
	From PDO2_Additional_question.json extract the responses for each cluster. 

Focus on the narratives answering these four questions and create a narrative for each cluster that contains: 
1. Number of beneficiaries expected to be accessing one or more enhanced Climate Information Service (CIS). Where possible, list the CIS innovations that are being made accessible and write the number of beneficiaries that are expected to access each innovation.(e.g. 1- iSAT= 40.000; 2- program in local radio= 20.000; 3)
2. Number of beneficiaries expected to be accessing one or more validated climate-smart agriculture technologies (CSA) . Where possible, list the CSA innovations that are being made accessible and write the number of beneficiaries that are expected to access each innovation.(e.g. 1- Drought-tolerant maize=50.000 farmers; 2- Smart valley= 3.000 ...)
3. Number and name the CSA+CIS bundles that are being made accessible to beneficiaries, and write the number of beneficiaries that are expected to access each bundle (e.g. 1- "Lersha" agro-advisory+wheat= 60.000 farmers; 2- "Esoko" agro-advisory+yam+ insurance= 20.000; ...)
4. Number of women expected to be accessing enhanced enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies


## Cluster-Level Achievements:
Do not group clusters together. Each cluster must be presented in its own section/paragraph. Create separate sections for each of the following clusters:

Senegal (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative)
Ghana (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative)
Zambia (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative)
Mali (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative)
Kenya (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative)
Ethiopia (Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative)


For each cluster Ensure to put the VALUE of End_year_achieved in the narrative (don't summarise the thematics clusters), use the corresponding [Achieved_narrative] from PDO2_Contributions.json and put the [End_year_achieved] (Ensure put the number for each cluster, Senegal, Ghana, Zambia, Mali, Kenya, Ethiopia).
Extract by cluster the insights from the PDO2_Additional_question.json filtering by Cluster que column :
1. Number of beneficiaries expected to be accessing one or more enhanced Climate Information Service (CIS). Where possible, list the CIS innovations that are being made accessible and write the number of beneficiaries that are expected to access each innovation.(e.g. 1- iSAT= 40.000; 2- program in local radio= 20.000; 3)
2. Number of beneficiaries expected to be accessing one or more validated climate-smart agriculture technologies (CSA) . Where possible, list the CSA innovations that are being made accessible and write the number of beneficiaries that are expected to access each innovation.(e.g. 1- Drought-tolerant maize=50.000 farmers; 2- Smart valley= 3.000 ...)
3. Number and name the CSA+CIS bundles that are being made accessible to beneficiaries, and write the number of beneficiaries that are expected to access each bundle (e.g. 1- "Lersha" agro-advisory+wheat= 60.000 farmers; 2- "Esoko" agro-advisory+yam+ insurance= 20.000; ...)
4. Number of women expected to be accessing enhanced enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies
Ensure to put at least five paragraphs (four for the questions respectively) by cluster extracting the insights from Narrtive by each Question from PDO2_Additional_question.json abording each Question

# Conclusion:
Generate a narrative how the overall achievements and the separate, detailed cluster-level demonstrate Beneficiaries in the project area are increasingly accessing enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies.

# Important:
- Don't summarise of all, give me the all relevant details of each cluster in the PDO Indicator 2
- Do not combine or group clusters into one summary. Each cluster (6) must have its own clearly delineated section.
- The final output should be a single cohesive text in plain language, written in a formal and professional tone suitable for submission to the World Bank.
- Don't reference to the sources in the output.
- Ensure you put the following sections:
    - Introduction/Overview:
    - Overall Numerical Summary:
    - New beneficiaries gaining access to CIS/adopting validated CSA :
    - Cluster-Level Achievements
