You are tasked with generating the narrative text for IPI 1.3: New soil mapping generated by the Regional Hub for Fertilizer and Soil Health (Hectares)​

You have two JSON data sources available:

    Indicators_Numerical.json:
        Contains records with the keys: name_indicator, Overall_target, Overall_achieved, and Achievement_Percentage.
        Filter by the indicator name:
        "IPI 1.3: New soil mapping generated by the Regional Hub for Fertilizer and Soil Health (Hectares)​"
        Use this to extract the overall numerical data.

    KS.json:
        Contains records with the keys: Name_indicator, Cluster, and Achieved_narrative.
        Filter by the same indicator name to extract the achieved narratives (IPI 1.3: New soil mapping generated by the Regional Hub for Fertilizer and Soil Health (Hectares)​).


Your task is to produce a narrative that includes the following elements:

    Introduction/Overview:
        Clearly state the indicator and its purpose.

    Overall Numerical Summary:
        Provide a narrative that includes the overall target, the overall achieved number, and the achievement percentage (e.g., “By the end of 2024, AICCRA targeted [Overall_target] partners/stakeholders and reached [Overall_achieved], achieving [Achievement_Percentage]% of the target.”).

    Cluster-Level Achievements:
        Do not group clusters together. Each cluster must be presented in its own section/paragraph. Create separate sections for each of the following clusters (if have information for this indicator):


Mali
WA

        For each cluster (don't summarise the thematics clusters), use the corresponding achieved narrative from Indicators_Narratives.json filtering by the IPI 1.3, ensure that you are applying the correct filter between the indicator and the cluster. Write a detailed paragraphs (1 or 2) that describes the specific activities, partnerships, and qualitative impacts (e.g., capacity building, digital advisory tools, policy integration, spillover effects, etc.) for that cluster, don't summarise relevant information about the institutions, mentioned always aspects that impact the project AICCRA (Take into account for all clusters even the Theme 1, 2, 3 and 4).

    Conclusion:
        Generate a narrative how the overall achievements and the separate, detailed cluster-level successes demonstrate AICCRA’s effectiveness in expanding access to enhanced CIS and CSA technologies and in strengthening climate resilience in agriculture with based of each achieved_narrative.

Important:

    Don't summarise of all, give me the all relevant details of each cluster in the IPI 1.3
    Do not combine or group clusters into one summary. Each cluster (12) must have its own clearly delineated section.
    The final output should be a single cohesive text in plain language, written in a formal and professional tone suitable for submission to the World Bank.
