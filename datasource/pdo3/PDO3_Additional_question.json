In aquaculture, farmers apply best management practices such as fishpond design, selection of fish species, biosecurity, temperature and water quality management, and fish feed management to optimize fish farming operations.\n\nThe primary dissemination channels include radio broadcasts and on-farm meetings with extension officials and agribusinesses under AICCRA\u0092s accelerator program.

Our data (D26408, page 26, Table 27), show that men are more likely to adopt than women. For CIS, the male:female ratio is 65:35 and the CSA ratio is 70:30 (varying slightly by practice). This is because the majority of our technologies are land based and thus men are more empowered to take independent management decisions."
