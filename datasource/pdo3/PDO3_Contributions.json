      "Achieved_narrative": "The 2024 MELIA survey with 426 households in 3 regions (Louga, Thies, Kaffrine) accessing CIS and CSA since 2022 shows that 29.76% of beneficiaries use improved varieties (CSA) i.e. 45,138 beneficiaries and 11% of beneficiaries use the microdosing technique. i.e. 16,684 beneficiaries. The results of the MELIA survey show that 59.38% use CIS, with exactly 90,068 beneficiaries. The different types of bundling involving radios+improved varieties+Telephone+training in CIS/CSA used nearly 23,858 beneficiaries. In support of the use of CIS/CSA, AICCRA intensified access of innovations and practices and built a Public-Private partnership which made it possible to provide advice on the use of these innovation.\nIn CSA, [OICR3694] found that limited awareness of new varieties, could contribute to the low adoption of CSA[D26431]. The strategy centered around community-based seed production, facilitated field demonstrations, created awareness and demand, and seed availability [D25816,D25818,D25944,D26785]. The use of improved varieties improves yields [D26764,D26784], creates net profitability [D25804] and women's empowerment [D26483,D26777,D26772]\nConsidering CIS, [OICR3693] showed that dissemination of climate-informed advisories significantly influenced adoption of climate-smart livestock practices among (agro)pastoralists, facilitating the transition from knowledge and attitude changes to implementation [D26491,D26774]. In parallel, radio listening clubs now help to keep radio programming relevant, engaging, demand driven [D26484]."

      "Achieved_narrative": "In the old implementing communities (2021-2024), radio extension reached an estimated 150,000 (40% women) listeners. This was complemented by Farmerline�s onboarding of 27,731 farmers(34% women), onto their platform for dissemination of CIS-CSA technologies. Additionally, in-person extension services led by the Department of Agriculture in the old communities reached an estimated 3,200 farmers with CIS-CSA innovations. Overall, an estimated 180,000 farmers in the old intervention areas accessed AICCRA innovations in 2024.\nAn assessment was conducted in December 2024 in these areas using a multistage sampling strategy. A total of 1,475 farmers who accessed AICCRA innovations were surveyed. Evidence from the study shows that out of the total sample, 963 respondents (65.3%) were using at least one of  AICCRA�s CIS and CSA innovations. \nInferring from this randomized and representative survey that had 65.3% of respondents who had accessed AICCRA innovations using at least one of them, the use of AICCRA innovations can be inferred to about 117,000 farmers, that is, 65% of the estimated 180,000 old beneficiaries Out of this, 30.5% are women. This inference is on the basis that there are homogeneous socioeconomic characteristics across the farming population in the implementation districts and the sample.  https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169229"

      "Achieved_narrative": "In 2024, the project conducted an independent evaluation of the farmers using the validated CSA technologies and enhanced CIS in the project sites.The evaluation revealed that 145,700 (43% women) are using the validated CSA CIS technologies (D26316, D25914).  \n\nAICCRA Zambia has significantly empowered smallholder farmers in the Eastern Province by equipping them with validated CSA practices and enhanced CIS to adapt to climate change. Field discussions with farmers revealed that those who adopted AICCRA�s climate-smart solutions, such as drought-resistant seed varieties, agroforestry with Gliricidia, and agro-advisories on better planting timing, achieved improved yields, even during challenging seasons. In Eastern Province, COMACO directly trained 175,000 farmers through its cooperative model, with 130,000 (50% women) adopting CSA practices (D26316).\n\nThe aquaculture practices among smallholder fish farmers in Northern Zambia are undergoing a remarkable transformation driven by CSA solutions implemented by the AICCRA project in the region. The project is transforming the way fish farming is practiced in the region, creating more resilient communities and sustainable farming systems. The project has significantly enhanced their livelihoods by empowering 15,700 (36% women) with CSA technologies, strengthening their resilience through access to aquaculture advisories, and creating markets to sustainably improve their income and food security (D25914)."

Crop diversification was encouraged through targeted training and solar irrigation, while women rice processors benefited from the GEM parboiling technique. Farmer group-based learning and institutional partnerships enhanced knowledge exchange, technology dissemination, and financial access.\n\nThis indicator has been overachieved because of the use of context specific mechanisms innovations, enhancing farmers' knowledge, while creating the enabling environment for adoption."

      "Achieved_narrative": "D26408 and OICR 3592 summarise the evidence of our achievements. We conducted comprehensive household survey and key informant interview with partners to assess the utilization of core CSA technologies among beneficiaries. Different pathways were used to reach beneficiaries: KAOP platform, radio talkshows, dissemination of drought-tolerant crops seed, agro-advisories through iSAT, Kaznet digital livestock information platform. AICCRA has been working in some of the target counties since 2022 and others more recently.\n\nApproximately 300,000 farmers in 7 target counties reported using one or more CSA technologies and our CIS product with the highest reported use came in at 269,360. Because our CIS interventions also largely focused in the same 7 counties  the sample for the CIS recipients was highly overlapping with the CSA recipients and difficult to disentangle. To avoid inflating accomplishments or double counting - and because we are already significantly overachieving - our reported achievement is a very conservative estimate that assumes full overlap of the CSA and CIS users. \n\nOur findings revealed significant uptake and usage across the targeted areas, with beneficiaries integrating these solutions into daily practice. For instance, CIS advisories disseminated through radio and targeted SMS have equipped farmers with actionable knowledge to make climate-resilient decisions."

Bundling with credit and insurance services has enabled farmers to access and manage loans and investments (D25696, D25736).\n\nAICCRA played a key role in the conceptualization, financial and technical support, coordination, and validation of geospatially staged agroecology-specific fertilizer recommendations for both inorganic and organic fertilizers. This innovation is now integrated into CGIAR science programs and AICCRA spillover initiatives. In Hadiya and Kembata Zones, farmers trained in soil and water conservation have restored 5,205 hectares (D25695).\n\nSince 2021, 68% of farmers (60,928) out of 89,600 reached by ICARDA have adopted SmaRT-Pack innovations through partnerships with MoA, RARIs, universities, and media (FANA, EBC, 30% women) to enhance small ruminant productivity using climate-smart forage and feed technologies"
