This is a key focus of the ECOWAS Rice Observatory. In response to this and demand from Malian government, the Mali cluster developed the RIICE tool to monitor rice areas and yields, and assess climate change effects. At a MITA workshop, government officials from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire showed strong interest in RIICE, leading to its adaptation for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in 2024. Key activities involved creating a rice baseline and ecosystem map, estimating rice areas and yields for the wet season, and validating yield predictions through field experiments. Using satellite data and the ORYZA crop growth model, the project achieved 89.5% accuracy in rice area mapping and estimated an average yield of 4.7 t\/ha."
