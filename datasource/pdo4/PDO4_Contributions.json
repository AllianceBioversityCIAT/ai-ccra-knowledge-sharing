      "Achieved_narrative": "AICCRA Zambia collaborated with agricultural training institutions to develop a Climate Risk Management in Agricultural Extension (CRMAE) Reference Guide for Zambia. This guide provides foundational knowledge on climate and agricultural decision-making, along with practical tools for analyzing climate-related risks (D25928). While the guide is not yet available in other Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, it has been adapted to the Agriculture to Climate Today (ACToday) project, which operates in six countries: Bangladesh, Colombia, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Senegal, and Vietnam. This adaptability makes it suitable for application in other SSA countries and will ultimately enable them to access and use validated Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices and enhanced Climate Information Services (CIS) based on lessons learned from AICCRA Zambia.\n\nThe training is designed for agricultural extension professionals who actively support farmers with information, advice, and other services. It specifically targets extension agents working at ward and sub-county levels within Zambiaï¿½s public agricultural extension service, as well as non-governmental extension and advisory service professionals with a similar background. Course activities require a working knowledge of web browsers, Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint."

      "Achieved_narrative": "The availability of accurate and seasonally updated data on rice cultivation areas, forecasted and harvested yields, is essential for informed decision-making on food security, natural resource management, agricultural productivity, and insurance. These priorities are central to the ECOWAS Rice Observatory.\n\nIn response to this need and the Cote d'Ivoire government for a tool for monitoring rice area, yield and climate change impacts, the RIICE tool has been developed by Mali cluster team under the auspices of the Regional Integrated Initiative of West and Central Africa. TKey activities conducted in 2024 included the generation of a rice baseline and ecosystem map, seasonal rice area estimation, and the assessment of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and yield estimations using an upgraded ORYZA crop growth model. The study leveraged multi-source remote sensing data, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, and SAOCOM, to improve the accuracy of rice area detection and yield predictions. Field experiments were conducted to calibrate and validate crop model. Findings indicate that the RIICE tool effectively identifies rice-growing areas with an 89.5% accuracy rate and provides reliable yield estimates ranging from 2.5 to 5.9 t/ha, aligning well with observed field data. Further information about this deliverable can be found in D26893."

(D25616)\n\n3- The Climate-Agriculture Modeling Decision Tool (CAMDT) developed for Zimbabwe made accessible for spillover to Malawi upon a request by Malawi Ministry of Agriculture (Department of Land Resource Conservation) through hands-on-capacity building training conducted by CCARDESA and AICCRA. The training workshop was held in Lilongwe, in December 2024 and attended by over 20 professionals from Lilongwe University of Agricultural Research (LUANAR), Ministry of Agriculture Department of Land Resources Conservation, the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services (DCCMS) and relevant departments.

Indeed, AICCRA engagement intentionally targeted FSRP countries a way to harness synergies between the two World Bank-funded programs.\nAchievements in East and Southern Africa are shared with ESA and Theme 4 cluster."

The CIFOR-ICRAF teams in the countries chose the CSA technologies (use of Gliricidia sepium for livestock feeding and integration of forages in existing farm systems from a list of innovations already in use in AICCRA countries. We then used training material from Ethiopia and Zambia to create tailored training materials."
