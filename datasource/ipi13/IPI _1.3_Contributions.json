    "Achieved_narrative": "The Regional Hub was to generate and present 500 thousand hectares of new soil information as digital soil maps under IPI 1.3 as target for 2024.Before being able to start field work to deliver this target, efforts have been geared towards setting up the Hub, including agreements with partners, setting up governance structures, agreements on the scope and operational model of the Hub, and investing in expertise and assets.Late 2024, following the demand-driven logic of the Hub, 11 country workshops were organized to prioritize in-country activities, resulting in agreement on a set of Wave 1 countries Ghana,Liberia,Nigeria,Togo ,Sierra leone)  and priority activities in those countries, in line with IPI 1.3 and IPI 1.4.\nAs a result, the 2024 targets will be carried forward and integrated into the 2025 target, ensuring that the groundwork laid this year will pave the way to accelerate our effort to achieve the set targets. The hub will leverage on its strategic country partnerships established and use existing regional soil maps (estimated at 40 million hectares using existing data ) as baseline for the development of the digital soil maps.  This strategic adjustment positions the Hub to effectively meet its commitments with a well-established operational framework)."
