    "Narrative": "1.\tRIICE platform: By providing real-time data on rice area and yield, the platform supports women farmers, who often have limited access to information. Gender-sensitive training in 2025 will enhance women capacity to access and use rice monitoring data for improved productivity and climate resilience.\n\n2.\tRice yield simulation platform: The tool supports inclusive decision-making by offering localized climate adaptation strategies tailored to diverse farming systems, including those managed by women and smallholders. This ensures equitable access to yield predictions and risk mitigation strategies.\n\n3.\tAg-data hub: By integrating multiple crops and supporting startups, the hub enhances economic opportunities for women and youth-led agribusinesses. It facilitates access to climate and soil data, enabling informed decision-making and fostering resilience among vulnerable farming communities."

    "Narrative": "Gender considerations were key in the set-up and operation of the CSA hubs;\n\nFirst, membership of all district CSA hubs working group included officers from the Women in Agriculture Development Directorate (WIAD). This ensured that agenda-setting and prioritisation of innovations included those relevant to women including setting up women specific demo plots in communities. There were intentional actions to bring more women into the CSA hub working group. Forty-two (42) out of the 218 members of the working group members across all AICCRA intervention districts were women. Four (4) out of the 13 districts hubs were chaired by women. \n\nSecond, AICCRA targeted that 40% of members in the 65 community CSA hubs should be women to ensure that these farmers who became climate champions and change agents in their communities included women. Statistics indicate that 1318 members out of 2785 total members of the community CSA hubs were women."

    "Narrative": "Real time feeding of data into AgData Hub was made possible with the deployment of mobile apps for NARES to monitor and review their field activities/agro-advisories. Previous studies show that men and women perceive differently the importance of context-specific climate information to be shared with them. Therefore, gender sensitive information is part of the data collection protocol to inform the AgData Hub. This refers to; primary activities including postharvest, marketing, gender-represented value chains e.g. vegetable gardening. This is to ensure gender disparities are well represented in the data used to train machine learning models with the aim of guiding interventions or setting advisories to target women and/or youth's needs and interests. When specificities to gender dimension are represented in model training data, the programs based on the resulting algorithms may reduce biases."

Through our 2024 activities facilitating improved collaboration between KALRO and KMD, the KAOP has been enhanced through the integration of climate data from KMD in addition to global data sets, when it previously had drawn on expensive global private sector climate data. By facilitating new data flow between KMD and KALRO, AICCRA has fostered a new era of practical public sector collaboration between the agricultural and meteorological sector organisations, strengthening public sector capacity to reliably deliver quality agclimate advisories in a timely fashion. AICCRA also integrated livestock market data from KAZNET into the KAOP dashboard, improving access for public and private sector entities to this valuable information. These enhancements are captured in D25793, D25981 and D25794."
