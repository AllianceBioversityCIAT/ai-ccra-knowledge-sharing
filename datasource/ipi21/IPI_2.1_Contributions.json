    "Achieved_narrative": "[OICR3565] In 2024, AgData Hubs achieved key milestones including migration of the platform to ANACIM�s server and integration with GTP portal. The Hub has been institutionalized and embedded within the GTP framework (Multidisciplinary Working Group) of ANACIM and complemented the GTPs functioning and role in generation and provisioning of context specific CIS. Through the Hubs, GTPs can avail Agromet Decision Support as well as automation of the climate services. In 2024, it provided seasonal forecasts for short- and medium-term climate projections to generate CIS for strategic decision support. Further, the Hub through APIs enabled climate and weather data access to ANCAR�s agro-advisories system and paved the way for a frictionless collaboration between ANACIM and ANCAR.\n\nFurther, the platform was adapted and enhanced to respond to user-demand through 1) trainings with GTP members including technicians from ANACIM and managers of Rural Development services (ANCAR and others) on the functionalities for better decision-making in the agro-sylvo-pastoral development sectors in Senegal [D25948]; 2)  AgData Hub was introduced to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Security's technical advisers [D26498], and to experts in the Livestock Community of Practice [D26486]. \nThe platform hosted on ANACIM servers can be accessed here: (http://3.138.167.184/gtp/)."

The prototype has demonstrated that the platform can send messages and is stable when linked to weather data and information sources to generate advisories for aquaculture farmers. The prototype is linked to the AI model developed for the air and pond water temperature algorithms."

    "Achieved_narrative": "In 2024, three climate advisory platforms were launched or strengthened to enhance agricultural decision-making and climate adaptation.\n\n1.\tRIICE Platform: Validated for irrigated, rainfed lowlands, and uplands in Mali, RIICE monitors rice area, yield, and climate change impacts. Training sessions in 2025 will support its institutionalization (D25881). Potential users of the RIICE Platform include the Ministry of Agriculture, IER, Ministry of Environment and policymakers. \n\n2.\tRice Yield Simulation Platform: Developed using data from 17,647 fields across 12 West African countries, this digital tool integrates climate, soil, and agronomic data, achieving over 75% accuracy in yield prediction. It provides insights for climate adaptation and sustainable rice production (D25788). Potential users of the rice yield simulation platform include the Ministry of Agriculture, IER, Ministry of Environment and policymakers.\n\n3.\tAg-Data Hub: An enhanced Mali Ag-Data Hub, launched in November 2024, now covers multiple crops beyond groundnut. It integrates soil, weather, drought indices, and production data to support startups, advisory services, and policymaking (D25787). Potential users of the Ag-Data Hub include the national meteorological agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment, policymakers."

    "Achieved_narrative": "Since the beginning of AICCRA, we have been working very closely with the Kenya Agricultural Observatory Platform, which is a joint product between the Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) and the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD). Through our 2024 activities facilitating improved collaboration between KALRO and KMD, the KAOP has been enhanced through the integration of climate data from KMD in addition to global data sets from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite (TAMSAT). By facilitating new data flow between KMD and KALRO, AICCRA has fostered a new era of practical public sector collaboration between the agricultural and meteorological sector organisations. AICCRA also integrated livestock market data from KAZNET into the KAOP dashboard, improving access for public and private sector entities to this valuable information. These enhancements are captured in D25793, D25981 and D25794."

By consolidating disparate data systems, it provides a comprehensive view of the agricultural sector, facilitating data-driven decisions that boost farmer productivity and sustainability. The Integrated National Ag-datahub (D26393)  was further developed to improve admin dashboard, integrate datahub user guide, integrate data taxonomy tree, improve landing page and integrated with different mini-hubs including the Natural resources and aLive data lakes at MoA. Further it was linked to with Ethioseed system (D26426), the CSA knowledge hub (D254644) and ELaRP platforms (https://csa-knowledgehub.org.et/; https://csa-knowledgehub.org.et/elarp). The user-feedback system was developed and integrated with the Ag-data Hub (D25689). \n\nA new EDACaP web-based user interface with advanced analytical capabilities and functions for crop modeling (D25703, https://datahub.moa.gov.et/;   https://datahub.eiar.gov.et/) was be made available to Ethiopian ATI, EIAR, and MoA, and EDACaP was linked for the first time with ATI's 6028 national phone hotline via API for dissemination of advisories to beneficiaries and end users."
