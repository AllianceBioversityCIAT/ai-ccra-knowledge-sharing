    "Narrative": "[1] - Climate-Smart Irrigation for nutritious vegetables, and facilitating better post-harvest handling and market access. Establishment of Climate-Smart Irrigation Facilities, and these included Solar-Powered Pumps and Drip Irrigation Systems. This was followed by: i) improving access to fast-growing, high-value, and nutritious vegetables by establishing horticultural fields and distributing seeds. In Mozambique for example, starter packs of seeds were provided to farmers, including onion, cucumber, maize, cabbage, and tomato, enabling them to kickstart their production; ii) Comprehensive training on financial literacy, sustainable pest management, water management, climate-smart practices, horticultural crop production, pest and disease control, agro-processing, and marketing; iii) Training of Trainers on climate smart technologies, where  selected partners from Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe were trained on climate smart technologies to further trained the farmers; iv) Facilitating post-harvest handling, distribution, and market access through market linkages and community companies."

The bundle which was disseminated through an integrative channel (radio, mobile, in-person extension) leveraged on women's collective mobilisations in village savings and loans groups and self-help labor groups to reach more women.  \n2. Bundled solution for cowpea, including CIS-CSA, biopesticides, roller planters, and market information, supported women to address challenges of erratic rainfall, low access to smart seeds, and pests and disease incidence in cowpea production. Its dissemination leveraged on women's collective action in VSLAs to improve access to smart seeds and acquisition of roller planters. \n3. Bundled solution for sweet potato, includingCIS-CSA, bio-logical of weevils, and processing, supported women to address challenges of erratic rains and weevil infestation and to harness the nutritional benefits of OFSP through multiple utilisations."

Additionally, it focused on documenting stories of change to identify outcome results from the initiative. Below is a list of deliverables that contributed to customized technologies designed for women and youth.\n1. Drought-tolerant seed varieties were disseminated through direct interactions and training with beneficiaries via their producer associations (D26809). The private sector, through seed bundle 3, is also playing a significant role in ensuring that these seed varieties reach women in the soybean and groundnut value chains.\n2. Climate-smart fish species, feed, water quality management and other sustainable aquaculture practices were disseminated by the private sector under aquaculture bundle 2  (D25893)"
