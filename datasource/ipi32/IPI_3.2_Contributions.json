    "Achieved_narrative": "AICCRA Ghana, building on gains from 2021-2023, developed bundled climate solutions for women farmers who dominate groundnut production in northern Ghana, cowpea production in the north and transition belt, and sweet potato production in the coastal savannah belt. \n\nThe bundled solution for groundnut included soil fertility management, smart seeds, rotation with cereal, roller planters to reduce the drudgery of associated with planting, and post-harvest advisories. The bundled solution for cowpea included dual-purpose seeds, neem extracts for nematode control, rotation with cereals, roller platers, and credit and market access. The bundled solution for sweet potato included biological control for weevils, organic amendment of soils, and sweet potato processing for improved nutrition. Seasonal forecast and cropping calendar were crosscutting for all the bundles.\n\nThe bundles were disseminated through multiple channels including demonstrations at CSA hubs with specific demos for women, radio extensions targeting times suitable for women and with women's groups as listening clubs, text and voice messages, and in-person training intentionally targeted at women Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs). The bundles reached an estimated 5,000 women groundnut farmers, 10,000 women cowpea farmers, and 2,000 women sweet potato farmers. https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169233"

    "Achieved_narrative": "In 2024, the project strengthened access to validated CSA technologies and enhanced CIS tailored to the interests of women and youth. It utilized user-friendly channels that facilitated easier understanding and adoption of these technologies by women. For example, women fish farmers who faced challenges in using CSA technologies, such as fingerlings, water quality management, and feed management, were provided with training materials translated into their local language and customized to their level of understanding (D25901). This intervention enhanced their ability to access and effectively use CSA products.\n\nFurthermore, women interested in drought-tolerant soybean production received hands-on training through their producer associations to enhance their ability to adopt and utilize relevant technologies tailored to their needs (D26809). \n\nAdditionally, gender experts collaborated with small and medium enterprises to document transformative stories of women farmers who adopted customized technologies such as solar irrigation, aquaculture, and climate-smart groundnut and soybean seed varieties. These stories serve as inspiration, encouraging other women to access and utilize technologies designed to meet their specific needs (D25893, D25991, D25906)."

By distributing them through farmers' organizations, women gain direct access to improved mechanization, increasing efficiency and productivity. Evidence about the mechanical transplanters, direct seeders and mechanical weeders can be found in D25884. \n\n4.\tSaving for change mechanism: This initiative enhances women farmers' financial access, enabling them to invest in quality seeds of drought-tolerant rice, vegetables, and potatoes. Evidence about saving for change mechanism can be found in D25771. \n5.\tWomen-led Centers for Mechanized Agriculture (CEMA): These centers ensure women’s equitable access to mechanization, RiceAdvice recommendations, and CIS. Evidence about CEMA can be found in D25757. \n6.\tGender and Climate Change Action Plan: This plan serves as an advocacy tool to raise awareness and enhance women’s decision-making in CSA and CIS adoption.

    "Achieved_narrative": "AICCRA Kenya's work promoting drought tolerant crops (DTC) (millet, sorghum, pigeon pea) continues to have a strong focus on women's priorities and interests, starting with the foundation that DTCs are largely seen as \"women's crops\" in the local contexts, as reported in early years of AICCRA. Technologies targeting women include DTC seed varieties (DD26502), DTC recipe books (D26288), DTC harvest and post-harvest handling practices (D26297). The integrated dissemination of DTC and CIS has been further supported by co-development of community radio programming designed and aired at times to reach women (D25998). Taken as a bundle, dissemination of these women-targeted technologies support strengthen climate resilience in drylands agriculture while promoting gender inclusive economic growth as well as improved household nutrition.\n\nIn pastoral areas, AICCRA Kenya's work on participatory rangeland management strengthens women's roles in leadership and community decision making through explicitly including women's knowledge and representation in the formation of local rangeland management committees and in the design of rangeland management plans, spaces where women have not customarily had opportunities for meaningful inputs. This is evident in community engagements (D25979, D25958, D25959) as well as in the practitioner guidelines developed for the IGAD Centre for Pastoral Areas and Livestock Development (D25978)."

Additionally, efforts were made to explore better market opportunities for higher return. (D25617)\n\n- In collaboration with the CAADP-XP4 program, and Botswana Farmers Association (BOFA), CARDESSA organised a knowledge sharing and exchange symposium between women and youth in agriculture (D25613). The symposium with 67 women and youth, facilitated sharing of successful case studies of agricultural enterprises and the deployment of innovative practices, including preserving and utilizing indigenous seeds, integrating traditional crops and livestock into modern value chains, and implementing CSA (D26455 - https://www.ccardesa.org/ccardesa-places-limelight-youth-and-women-agriculture). The specific technologies included indigenous vegetables, agro-forestry for land and water, small livestock, community seed banks, organic farming, value addition.\n\n- Most activities planned under this IPI are led by ASARECA and CARDESSA, and because of inability to pre-finance these activities, we have experienced delays in implementation."
