    "Achieved_narrative": "In 2024, AICCRA facilitated two major capacity-strengthening events: one for national partners in scaling initiatives and another for partners at district and community CSA hubs. These trainings were led by AICCRA Theme 2 and AICCRA Ghana clusters, respectively. Additionally, the Ghana cluster organized technical support sessions for agri-business enterprises, preparing them for an AICCRA-led Accelerator Grant Challenge. The challenge focused on implementing CSA and CIS bundled solutions, including Climate-Smart IPM, water-smart solutions for women vegetable farmers, smart production and soils (emphasizing sustainable agricultural mechanization options), and smart seeds and market systems.\n\nPartnership satisfaction surveys conducted during these programs revealed the following:\n\nGhana Scaling Week: All six respondents indicated familiarity with and application of AICCRA knowledge.\nCSA Hub Working Group Workshop: All 10 respondents confirmed familiarity with and usage of AICCRA knowledge.\nAccelerator Matchmaking: All five respondents were familiar with AICCRA knowledge, with three actively using it."

University CSA/CIS curricula (71%) AICCRA's tailor-made curricula have been approved by Kenya's Commission for University Eductation (CUE) for Taita Taveta University and Muranga University, with pending approval for Chuka University and Laikipia University. The first MSc students at TTU are beginning their research phase. (D26009)\n\n2. The agdata hub (50%). The AgData Hub deepened its contribution to the Kenya Agricultural Observatory Platform through functional integration of KMD and KARLO data, additional new features (Kaznet market information), and handing over practical management of the AgData Hub to KAOP staff. (D25793, D25794)\n\n3. The mobile app for KMD's volunteer climate observers (77%). This innovation was developed at the request of KMD to improve the speed and quality of data collection from volunteer climate observers in the counties. (D26345, D26349)\n\n4. The Kaznet digital platform for collecting and disseminating real time data on livestock markets (67%). Kaznet has expanded the functionality to improve dissemination of information. It has also expanded into new counties. (D26342, D25954, D25955)\n\n5. The community-based seed production for drought tolerant crops (63%). This work is an important step in establishing smallholders' access to quality seeds, both directly and through seed value chains (D25962)"
