    "Narrative": "A deliberate effort in 2024-survey was made to ensure diverse representation, including gender balance, in respondent selection. \n\nCRMAE Curriculum: A total of 11 respondents participated, with 4 women (36%). The relatively balanced representation was achieved by engaging learning institutions and training programs actively promoting gender inclusion in enrollment and outreach.\n\nUser-Centric CIS from EDACaP: Out of 8 respondents, 2 were women (25%). While efforts were made to recruit a gender-diverse sample, existing disparities in access to CIS tools�often influenced by digital literacy and decision-making roles in agricultural households�contributed to this proportion of women respondents.\n\nSmall Ruminants Innovations (SmaRT Pack): The lowest female participation was only 1 woman among 16 respondents (6%). This reflects underlying gender norms in livestock management but despite this, targeted outreach strategies, such as engaging women's groups and cooperatives, were employed to encourage female participation."
