      "Narrative": "A factor of 2 was applied, indicating that for each direct beneficiary using the CSA and CIS technologies disseminated by the cluster, one additional household member was also influenced to use these technologies. This factor was estimated from the household survey conducted by the cluster. This estimation was based on PDO3 rather than PDO2, as mere access to CSA and CIS does not necessarily lead to enhanced resilience in the context of Mali. Instead, resilience is expected to improve through the actual use of CSA and CIS technologies. In fact, some farmers who have access to CSA and CIS may choose not to use them, which would not contribute to enhanced resilience."

      "Narrative": "The indirect beneficiaries were estimated through tracking of beneficiaries that are accessing AICCRA innovations without AICCRA funds. \n\nFirst, farmers who accessed AICCRA innovations indirectly through in-person activities with extension officers under the FSRP,  are estimated to be 5,000 farmers. This is based on estimates provided by the Department of Agriculture. \n\nSecond, reports from our digital scaling partners indicated that an estimated 30,000 farmers accessed this content indirectly through their digital platforms. Sycompï¿½s USSD code with AICCRA innovations, for instance, was accessed by an estimated 9,000 farmers outside AICCRA focus regions. \n\nThird, FRI estimates that about 20% of the adult population in an area listen to radio extensions. Estimates of the 20% adult population who listen to radio extensions that broadcast AICCRA innovations outside our intervention areas is about 300,000 beneficiaries."
