The CoP is an established multi-stakeholder platform designed to gather expertise and promote knowledge-sharing. Its members work together to find innovative, relevant and effective solutions for agro-pastoralists, using appropriate communication channels (IVR by JOKALANTE and 3 rural radios) reaching +78k herders in 3 regions: Linguere, Dagana and Ranerou [D26780,D26486,D25947]. The CoP members accessed and made use of Decision Support Tools (data interoperability, AgData Hub [D25976,D26486], WENDOU (Water ENvironment Dashboard for Observation)  by CSE [D25951]), livestock price forecast tool [D26403], indigenous knowledge and scientific & practical expertise of its members (ISRA, ANCAR, AVSF, DIREL)[D26770]. This allows producers organizations (RESOPP, ADID, APAFIL) and private organization (KSDE) to offer bundle services of CIS-CSA to their members [D25944,D25950]. Recognizing the positive outcomes of the CoP to respond to the needs of pastoral communities who are currently adopting advisories, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (DIREL) decided to integrate the CoP function into the pastoralist committee [D26765,D26769,D26781]. Moreover, the CoP is promoting climate-resilient (agro)pastoral systems at the interface of research, education, and practice [D26306,D26309]."
