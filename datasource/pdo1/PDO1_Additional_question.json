Others include, developing an Action Plan for the Kenya Drought Watch System and Reviewing Triggers and Thresholds for Drought Anticipatory Action (D25601) targeting the Kenya Met Department and the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA). The Kenya National Drought Watch System is envisioned as a foundational model for other IGAD member states, showcasing the best drought monitoring and response practices. It also leverages protocols for drought triggers and thresholds developed by organizations such as ICPAC, WFP, FAO, the Red Cross, NDOC, KMD, and NDMA. By reviewing and refining these protocols, the system aims to enhance resilience to climate variability nationally and\nregionally."

      "Narrative": "Yes, the existing partners had their capacities to deliver validated CSA and enhanced CIS to target beneficiaries. In the long run, this is expected to create a multiplier effect. For example, agricultural training institutions, University of Zambia, ZMD, are now better equipped to deliver improved CSA and enhanced CIS to learners across the country following a number of trainings they received from the project (D25903, D25928, D25896). The same applies with DMMU, where a new mobile was developed to collect real-time data on climate hazards, such as floods and droughts (D25892). The project continued working with BongoHive to build the capacity of Early Career Researchers (ECRs) and practitioners in Zambia (D25897). This initiative equipped them with tools to address critical issues in agricultural water management, soil health, sustainability, and environmental science."
