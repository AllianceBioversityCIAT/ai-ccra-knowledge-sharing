The Kenya National Drought Watch System is envisioned as a foundational model for other IGAD member states, showcasing the best drought monitoring and response practices. It also leverages protocols for drought triggers and thresholds developed by organizations such as ICPAC, WFP, FAO, the Red Cross, NDOC, KMD, and NDMA. By reviewing and refining these protocols, the system aims to enhance resilience to climate variability nationally and\r\nregionally."
