    "Achieved_narrative": "Under [OICR3696], as reported Q3 of 2023, the collaboration between ILRI and IRI has targeted to develop the roadmap to scale the Climate Risk Management for Agricultural Extension (CRMAE). Therefore, a public consultation held with higher education stakeholders guided the process of embedment of CRMAE into training programs and several proposals were put forward. From that discussions new programs emerged with:\n(1) the CRMAE integration into UADB (University of Bambey) in Bachelor (semester6) and Master Programs (semester1) from 2025: https://hdl.handle.net/10568/168710\n(2) the CRMAE integration into Ministry of Agriculture education Program in 2025 after the support of AICCRA with a ToT involving 20 people including trainers. A decision was officially shared to integrate CRMAE into agricultural education system' networks at national scale with the buying of high-level authority representative [https://cgiar.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/AICCRA/Clusters%20Sections/03.%20Senegal/2024/EndYear%20Reporting/CamScanner%2020-11-2024%2013.54.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=OEvObe]\n(3)  Another outstanding example with the Universit� du Sine-Saloum El Hadji Ibrahima Niass (USSEIN), which launched four new certificates on CRMAE in October 2024 in Kaolack with the support of US State Grant. \nUnder [OICR3692], it is reported (4) an investment decision from the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Security (MAESA) for the integration of CoP information services into the national pastoral alert system in Senegal [D26765]."

    "Achieved_narrative": "Influencing policy demands sustained stakeholder engagement at the highest levels. AICCRA Ghana collaborated with public and private leaders to operationalize Ghana�s National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) and initiated efforts to establish a legislative instrument (LI) granting the Ghana Meteorological Agency (Gmet) authority to regulate climate information services. To ensure inclusivity, Gmet formed a committee with members from public organizations, TAHMO, AICCRA, and USAID-Policy Link. AICCRA and Policy Link led a series of meetings, supporting the legal firm drafting the LI.\n\nAICCRA also influenced significant policy advancements through its publication by Sekabira et al. (2022) and subsequent efforts in 2023 when the Plant Protection and Regulatory Services Directorate (PPRSD) of Ghana�s Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) signed an MoU with 11 institutions on Early Warning, Rapid Response, and Pest and Disease (EWRRS-PD) Management. This collaboration was further strengthened in 2024 with an operational handbook for EWRRS-PD led by AICCRA.\n\nEarly outcomes during the reporting period include Gmet and private Climate Information Services� involvement in regional Research Extension Linkage Committee planning sessions and enhanced collaboration supporting MoFA-PPRSD�s leadership in EWRRS-PD, bolstering its mandate and operational capacity. AICCRA supported the development of a  new EWRRS_PD digital tool to help operationlisation efforts."

The Mali cluster lead spearheaded the development of the concept note and the full proposal, drawing on lessons from AICCRA in Mali. The proposal emphasizes CSA, CIS, early warning systems, capacity building, scaling, and policy�key AICCRA focus areas actively implemented in Mali.\n\n2.\tThe McKnight Foundation allocated $160,000 to scale the system of rice intensification for climate resilience, food security, and malaria mitigation in Mali. Led by the Mali cluster lead, the proposal builds on results from AWD validation and scaling, drought-resilient rice varieties, and improved crop establishment by the Mali cluster. It focuses on scaling efforts, impact assessment, and policy brief development."

This commitment to investing in the CRMAE marks a tremendous accomplishment in embedding climate change capacities into public sector institutions. However, we note that this is not a policy, and may not be seen as an investment.\n\nCRMAE- Kenya is a 2-week course aims to equip agricultural extension workers to access, understand and incorporate climate information into their professional work. It is designed to provide foundational knowledge on climate and agricultural decision making; and practical tools to analyse climate-related risks, use appropriate weather and climate information to support agricultural decisions, communicate complex climate information effectively with farmers, and integrate climate services into agricultural extension activities. It targets agricultural extension agents working at the ward and sub-county levels within Kenya�s public sector agricultural extension service, and non-government extension and advisory service professionals with a comparable background."

Envisioned to integrate gender-responsive strategies into climate policies, strategies, programs and actions. Seeks to empower women, enhance their resilience, and ensure their active participation in climate action.\n\n2. The Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture issued a Ministerial Directive on Soil and Agronomy Data Management, Use, and Sharing. This directive establishes a structured framework for the classification, storage, accessibility, and utilization of soil and agronomy data, ensuring that key stakeholders in the agriculture sector have reliable, high-quality, and timely data to inform decision-making (https://nsis.moa.gov.et/documents/134).\n\n3.AICCRA technically contributed to the design of a $424 million Lowland Livelihood Resilience Project-II (https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099030524154535796/bosib1334703ce0d41bf4914e941b00bb0a), supporting 3 million marginalized pastoral and agropastoral communities in Ethiopia (https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_4991566).  Specifically, AICCRA supported designing Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning framework.  \n\nAICCRA initiated technical support to Food Systems Resilience Program (FSRP) for improving enabling environment especially in small-scale irrigation development and management."

This bundle included input financing, insurance, and mechanized services tailored to reduce climate risks, stabilize cash flows, and attract private sector investment for sorghum farmers. This financial product unlocked USD 520,800 credit line fostering access to a CSA bundled loan product (OICR 3577; D25734)\n\n* AICCRA's successful collaboration with national partners such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Sovereignty, Ministry of Environment and Ecological Transition, the Ministry of Finance led to develop the Senegal's CSAIP; a strategic framework to guide and structure the country's investments in the agricultural sector, addressing the challenges of climate change. Institutional endorsement and commitment to support the Senegal CSAIP's implementation was ratified at COP 29 [OICR3697; D26432; D26844]\n\n* Technical Guidance provided to the Siaya county government in Kenya led to the selection of 22 projects for implementation under the Climate Change Resilience Investment Grant/ World Bank�s FLLoCA Program [D26311; OICR3651]."
