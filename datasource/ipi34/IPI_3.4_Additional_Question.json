The CCGAP seeks to empower women, enhance their resilience, and ensure their active participation in climate action \n(ii) It promotes inclusive policy development, ensuring that climate adaptation and mitigation strategies address the specific needs and contributions of women across eight key sectors, including agriculture, disaster risk reduction, health, and infrastructure.\n(iii) The plan strengthens institutional capacity and accountability, requiring sectoral policies to incorporate gender-responsive measures to achieve sustainable climate resilience.\nLooking ahead to 2025, there is significant potential to replicate Ethiopiaï¿½s CCGAP model in other Eastern African countries through the ESA-Cluster. By leveraging Ethiopiaï¿½s experience, similar gender-responsive climate action frameworks can be developed in neighboring countries."
