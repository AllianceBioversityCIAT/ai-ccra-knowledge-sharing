We trained selected lead farmers on quality seed production of drought tolerant crops (D25962) to support the development of a DTC seed systems. Finally, we trained national and county staff on Participatory Scenario Planning, translating seasons climate forecasts into actionable and locally relevant recommendations for adaptation in the agricultural season (D26388, D26808).\n\nOur overachievement can be explained by the fact that the KMD mobile app (D26349) was developed as a \"just-in-time\" product in response to KMD's request and there were more trainees that initially anticipated."
