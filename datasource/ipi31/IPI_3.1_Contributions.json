Climate smart-IPM: Seasonal forecast, nowcast, pest alerts, weeding time, bio-pesticides, bio-rationales, post-harvest advisories, and premium market. Deployed for maize, cowpea, yam, sweet potato, and vegetables. 3,160 farmers (42% women) accessed through demonstrations and 38,510 (53% women) through voice and text messages. \n\n3. Smart seeds and markets: Seasonal forecast, nowcast, smart seeds (early maturing, drought, striga, and pests tolerant), cereal-legume intercropping, tied ridging, credit, and cooperative marketing. Deployed for maize, cowpea, and groundnut. 4,820 farmers (47% women) accessed through demonstrations and 36,450 (58% women) through voice and text messages. \n\nThe cluster was not able to disaggregate beneficiaries who accessed the specific bundles through radio"

    "Achieved_narrative": "AICCRA Kenya has made significant contributions to improving smallholder resilience to climate change through the dissemination of a wide variety of climate smart agricultural practices including improved seed varieties of drought tolerant crops (D26502), production of quality DTC seeds (D25962), post-harvest handling (D26297), and recipe books to strengthen DTCs' contribution to food systems and nutrition (D26288). We have also disseminated a wide variety of climate smart agronomic practices, including zai pits, ripping, furrowing, intercropping, cover cropping, crop rotation, mechanization, water management, integrated soil fertility management (all covered in D26304), as well as climate resilient forages (D26012). In pastoral rangelands, AICCRA Kenya activities have supported institutional capacity strengthening which is the bedrock of climate change adaptation (D25961, D25958, D25959, D25961, D25978, D25979).\n\nIn terms of climate information services, AICCRA Kenya has developed a mobile phone app and dashboard at the request of the Kenya Meteorological Department to support local volunteers' contributions to climate data collection and sharing (D26345).\n\nFinally, in collaboration with Theme 4, AICCRA Kenya developed and disseminated a textbook on Climate Risk Management in Agricultural Extension (CRMAE) for embedding adaptation concepts in extension training curriculum, an important step in institutionalising climate adaptation in the Kenyan agricultural development community (D25626)."
