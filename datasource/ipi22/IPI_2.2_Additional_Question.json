    "Narrative": "Join products and capacity building activities in areas where demand has been identified:\n\n- Regional Training on CSA, Soil Fertility Management, and Soil Health Monitoring for agricultural experts in ESA (D25611), and aimed to enhance the capacity of agricultural professionals across ESA to address the pressing challenges of climate change, land degradation, and food insecurity through cutting-edge tools and inclusive approaches. Key focus areas included fundamentals of CSA and its practical applications; advanced soil health monitoring techniques, including geospatial and digital soil mapping; policy advocacy for scaling CSA practices into regional and national frameworks; and gender mainstreaming to ensure inclusivity and equity in CSA initiatives. \n\nAICCRA-ESA and ICPAC organized a regional training program on sub-seasonal forecasting using Python-based Climate Predictability Tool (PyCPT v2.8). This advanced tool bridges the forecasting gap between short-term weather and seasonal predictions and aimed to strengthen capacity of NMHSs and ICPAC staff in sub-seasonal operational forecasting."

    "Question": "1. How is the capacity of regional organizations being strengthened?",
    "Narrative": "The cluster approach to capacity building consists of:\n- participatory co-creation and planning at the beginning of the years where all the activities and deliverables are co-created. We organise a regional planning workshop bringing together all the partners to co-develop all the activities and deliverables and ensure the alignment with AICCRA indicators\n- monthly meetings to monitor implementation of the activities. Regular bilateral weekly meetings are also organized to discuss specific strategic activities\n- mid-year progress workshop and annual writeshop to ensure quality control of the deliverables as well as the evidence of the outcomes. We provide critical comments and inputs to improve the quality of all the deliverables.\n\nThe process or approach has been highly appreciated by the partners and has strengthened the capacity of the regional partners in developing knowledge products."

    "Narrative": "Knowledge products led by regional organizations:\n\n- ICPAC: Sub-seasonal and seasonal climate forecasts generated and disseminated to users on regular basis. Forecasts include predictions for a few weeks to months, produced using advanced modeling techniques and provides crucial information on expected temperature, precipitation, and other climatic variables, for planning and decision-making in agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. Forecasts were shared through multiple channels (email, web portals, social media) for effectiveness, including guidance on interpretation and use.
