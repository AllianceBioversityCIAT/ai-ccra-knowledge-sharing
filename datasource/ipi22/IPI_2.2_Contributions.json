Sub-seasonal forecasting remains a challenging area globally. The training marks a significant step in addressing a critical gap in weather and climate prediction timescale. (D25616)\n-Capacity of NMHSs in GAD region strengthened to effectively contextualize, test, validate and use WRF-Hydro. (D25607)"
