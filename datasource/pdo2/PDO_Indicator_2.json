More than 416,000 farmers are accessing CIS through intensified use of radio networks that employ enhanced GSI in programming. This allowed more women with access to information (203,746 men vs 213, 026 women reached) [D26780,D2594]. To reinforce this, digital services with phone empowered farmers in decision making with customized and site-specific advisories: 1) Jokalante provided iSAT agro-advisories weekly through IVR to 956 (289 women) farmers based on seasonal forecasts to select crop varieties and\/or decide on the best time for crop operations [D25945]; 2) 807 herders (323 women) received livestock climate advisories through IVR to promote climate smart animal breeding, while CSE supported another 1,114 herders in Ranerou region. In conjunction with radio programs, local extension networks allowed 1) 9142 farmers (15% women) to access technological packages including climate smart seed mini-packs to increase crop production, nutrition, and rural wellbeing; 2) 1,121 (33% women) farmers learned about technology previously piloted and validated with climate impact analyses during their participation to demonstrations, farmers field days on tech parks and trainings [D26401,D25975,D25818]."},{"Component":"PDO","Name_indicator":"PDO Indicator 2: Beneficiaries in the project area are increasingly accessing enhanced climate information services and\/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies.

A total of 8,180 farmers (45% women) participated in these field demonstration activities. \n\nSecond, Syecomp, a digital agriculture service provider worked with the district CSA hubs to onboard 100,000 new farmers (57% women) unto their platform and disseminated  CIS-CSA innovations along the four bundles through voice and text messages, USSD and call centre services. Each farmer received approximately 50 text and 25 voice messages along the cropping calendar. \n\nThird, a 16-week radio extension programme with eight partner stations of Farm Radio International disseminated CIS-CSA innovations along the four bundles adapted to the cropping calendar of specific ecological zones. A total of 226,177 new beneficiaries accessed CIS-CSA innovations via this channel.\n\nThese channels worked collaboratively as members of the district CSA hubs. They complemented each other and reinforced information received from one channel with another."},{"Component":"PDO","Name_indicator":"PDO Indicator 2: Beneficiaries in the project area are increasingly accessing enhanced climate information services and\/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies.

A social media broadcast expanded the project's reach to an additional 14,968 farmers, bringing the total number of farmers reached to 15,577. However, these delays in signing contracts with the accelerator partners prevented the project from meeting its original target of reaching 104,200 beneficiaries.\n\nDespite these challenges, the project established a mechanization bundle to support farmers in accessing agricultural equipment such as tractors, shellers, and planters. Three sites were identified for technology demonstrations, with equipment deployed at these locations. The demonstrations integrated mechanization with irrigation, showcasing advanced agricultural practices.\n\nOverall, the agribusiness accelerator partners continue to aim to reach 104,200 smallholder farmers (40% women), enhancing their access to validated climate-smart agricultural technologies and improved climate information services. Youth, particularly those engaged in vegetable production and chicken rearing, are also expected to benefit from the services provided by the project."},{"Component":"PDO","Name_indicator":"PDO Indicator 2: Beneficiaries in the project area are increasingly accessing enhanced climate information services and\/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies.
