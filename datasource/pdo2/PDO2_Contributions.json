More than 416,000 farmers are accessing CIS through intensified use of radio networks that employ enhanced GSI in programming. This allowed more women with access to information (203,746 men vs 213, 026 women reached) [D26780,D25945]. To reinforce this, digital services with phone empowered farmers in decision making with customized and site-specific advisories: 1) Jokalante provided iSAT agro-advisories weekly through IVR to 956 (289 women) farmers based on seasonal forecasts to select crop varieties and/or decide on the best time for crop operations [D25945]; 2) 807 herders (323 women) received livestock climate advisories through IVR to promote climate smart animal breeding, while CSE supported another 1,114 herders in Ranerou region [D26780]. In conjunction with radio programs, local extension networks allowed  3) 9142 farmers (15% women) to access technological packages including climate smart seed mini-packs to increase crop production, nutrition, and rural wellbeing; 4)1,121 (33% women) farmers learned about technology previously piloted and validated with climate impact analyses during their participation to demonstrations, farmers field days on tech parks and trainings [D26401,D25975,D25818]."

Each farmer received approximately 50 text and 25 voice messages along the cropping calendar. https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169230; https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169389\n\nThird, a 16-week radio extension program with eight radio stations disseminated CIS-CSA innovations along the four bundles adapted to the cropping calendar of specific ecological zones. A total of 226,177 new beneficiaries accessed CIS-CSA innovations via this channel. https://hdl.handle.net/10568/169230; https://hdl.handle.net/10568/170125\n\nThese channels worked collaboratively as members of the district CSA hubs.They complemented each other and reinforced information received from one channel with another."

      "Achieved_narrative": "Due to the delayed start of the program in July 2024, the project was unable to meet its targets. Efforts were made to prefinance these activities, but we were only able to reach 15,577 beneficiaries, of which 609 farmers were directly reached by CG centers in collaboration with the National Association of Smallholder Farmers (D26809) and 14,968 farmers through social media engagements (D25991 and D25906). However, three local agribusinesses have since been engaged to help the project achieve its initial target of 104,200 beneficiaries (D25916, D25924, D25933).\n\nOverall, the agribusiness accelerator partners continue to aim to reach 104,200 smallholder farmers (40% women), enhancing their access to validated climate-smart agricultural technologies and improved climate information services. Youth, particularly those engaged in vegetable production and chicken rearing, are also expected to benefit from the services provided by the project."

Because many people accessed multiple services, these numbers are nested rather than additive. In order to avoid inflating our accomplishments or double counting, our achieved value is a VERY conservative estimate.\n\n�\tAgdata Hub KAOP : Over 600,000 farmers registered on the KAOP platform accessed information to inform decisions.\n�\tRadio Dissemination: Seasonal agro-weather advisories and agricultural advice broadcasted through radio reached 400,000 farmers in Kitui, Makueni, Kilifi, and Baringo counties, preparing them for the OND season.\n�\tSeed Distribution and Training: Approximately 5,000 farmers in Kitui, Makueni, Taita Taveta, and Baringo accessed drought-tolerant, high-yielding varieties.\n\nCSA Access:\nApproximately 300,000 farmers across seven counties accessed CSA technologies, nearing the target of 400,000. Key practices include agroforestry (268,000 farmers), improved crop management (328,000 farmers), water harvesting (296,000 farmers), and terracing (316,000 farmers).\n\nCIS Access:  364,000 farmers accessed CIS, especially weather and climate information (364,000 farmers). Crop management advice benefited 300,000 farmers, while market insights reached 176,000. Radio was the dominant channel, accessed by 79.8% of respondents.\n\nThese interventions highlight the transformative impact of integrating CSA technologies and CIS, fostering climate resilience and sustainable agriculture."

      "Achieved_narrative": "1.Since 2021, 319,100 farmers gained access to CIS and digital agricultural advisories through Lersha-CIMMYT collaboration under AICCRA (D25738). These services provide real-time, location-specific advisories that help farmers make informed decisions on crop-management and input-use. In 2024 alone, 89,823 farmers benefited from these advisories (D25738).\n\n2. In 2024, 9,208 farmers received site-specific fertilizer recommendations (SSFR), tailored to optimize soil fertility and crop yields, whereby 600 farmers got  them via Agricultural Commercialization Clusters (ACC) and 8,608 farmers through Lersha digital platform (D25736). These targeted interventions ensure farmers apply the right type and amount of fertilizer, leading to improved soil health, yield optimization, and cost efficiency (D25736).\n\n3. The SmaRT-Pack initiative, implemented in partnership with ICARDA, is revolutionizing livestock production through bundle of climate-smart small ruminant technologies. In 2024, this initiative expanded further as three national universities allocated a combined budget of USD 63,018 to support Community-Based Breeding Program (CBBP) villages, providing 4,000 farmers access to SmaRT-Pack innovations (D25694). These technologies enhance livestock productivity through (i) Improved breeding and genetic selection (ii) Climate-smart feeding and forage systems; (iii) Sustainable rangeland management. Additionally, media partnerships with FANA-Radio and Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) have amplified awareness and adoption of these innovations among smallholder farmers (D25694)."
