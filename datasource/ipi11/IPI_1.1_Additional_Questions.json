The InfoNote details the challenges of groundnut production and presents climate smart solutions to address these challenges. It also provides insights into institutional arrangements that can enable women access and use prioritised climate innovations, and concludes with a pathway for scaling smart groundnut production to many women.\n\nAt the conceptual level, the InfoNote showcases a systematic approach of developing a socio-technical innovation bundle that addresses both biophysical and institutional challenges driving women's vulnerability to climate risks. Thus, while the knowledge product applies to groundnut,  it also offers a framework for developing other socio-technical innovation bundles for women."

This inclusion ensures that women farmers receive relevant data to improve productivity and market access.\n�\tDigital tool for rice yield simulation. This newly developed tool integrates climate, soil, agronomic variables, and future climate data, to simulate rice yield, in response to the request from Mali government for a tool to plan rice production and be a net rice exporter.\n�\tRiceAdvice Lite. This new tool is a simplified version of RiceAdvice designed to address the needs from Ministry of Agriculture, IER and service providersto have a tool that requires less time to generate recommendations, can be used by literate farmers with limited agronomic knowledge, and supports crops like vegetables in addition to rice."

This is expected to improve yields among fish-farming households that heavily depend on aquaculture, particularly in Luapula and the Northern Provinces of Zambia. This region is vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and floods and has recently experienced incidents of erratic droughts.\n\nAdditionally, the mobile application for DMMU (D25892), though not mapped to this indicator, was a request by DMMU to help strengthen disaster response strategies by designing a tool that helps to collect real-time data."
