The Ag-data hub, initially focused on groundnut, now includes banana, maize, millet, potato, rice, and sweet potato. By integrating soil, weather, drought indices, and production data, it enhances agricultural insights, aiding farmers, researchers, and policymakers in decision-making (D25787).\n�\tEnhanced version of maproom. The Maproom, initially limited to temperature and rainfall data, now includes current and historical information on rainy season onset and cessation. These enhancements provide precise, localized insights, supporting better decision-making in agriculture, water management, and disaster risk reduction (D26298). \n�\tDigital tool for rice yield simulation. This newly developed tool integrates climate, soil, agronomic variables, and future climate data, to simulate rice yield, supporting Mali's ambition to be net rice exporter (D25788).\n�\tIntegrated rice-fish system suitability mapping. This new product utilizes GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) to map rice-fish farming suitability in Mali (D 25789). \n�\tRiceAdvice Lite. This new tool, adapted to the Malian context, is a simplified version of RiceAdvice designed to address key stakeholder needs. It generates recommendations more quickly, is accessible to literate farmers with limited agronomic knowledge, and supports crops beyond rice, including vegetables (D26383)."

Work on participatory rangeland management, drought tolerant crops both have substantial gender components by strengthening women's voices in community decision making and focusing on women's crops. \n\nTaken together, these knowledge products evidence our multi-pronged approach to transforming the institutional ecosystems for supporting climate change adaptation in Kenyan agriculture. By addressing everything from basic climate data processing, dissemination of CIS, knowledge and implementation of CSA practices, local institutional capacity for rangeland management, integrated knowledge of CIS/CSA in both university and agricultural extension education, AICCRA Kenya is making sustainable and transformative contributions to improving the adaptive capacity not only of farmers and herders, but of the entire country."
