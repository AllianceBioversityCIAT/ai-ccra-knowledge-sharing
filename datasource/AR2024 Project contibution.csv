The reporting on PDO3 needs to build on success stories on user experience in CIS/CSA (OICR3637). A case study (to build the OICR3640) is under development to investigate the perception of farmers for enhancement of their technical and marketing skills after their exposition, their user experience on climate smart seeds as well as the GSI [D25816].","The End-Year impact survey gave the adoption rate of 84.5% [D26784] of 336,535 [https://hdl.handle.net/10568/136175],

Considering CSA, an ex-ante analysis [OICR3694] found that limited awareness of new technologies, especially varieties, could contribute to the low adoption of some CSA practices [D26431]. AICCRA-SN used a public-private-partnership (ANCAR, ISRA, ADID, RESOPP) approach to create a seed system to accelerate uptake of new varieties. The strategy centered around community-based seed production, facilitated field demonstrations, created awareness and demand, and seed availability [D25816, D25818, D25944, D26785]. As result, users of CIS/CSA are improved from 24% (2022) to 37% (2023) and to 78% (2024) [D26764,D26784]. The use of improved CSA varieties, in particular cowpea, is generating higher net profitability for cowpea and peanut growers, while on average, farmers who adopted a new millet variety almost doubled yields [D25804]. Evidence of women's empowerment and success stories of women engaging in seed cooperatives are evidence of gender inclusivity [D26483, D26777, D26772]

Considering CIS, [OICR3693] showed that dissemination of climate-informed advisories significantly influenced adoption of climate-smart livestock practices among (agro)pastoralists, facilitating the transition from knowledge and attitude changes to implementation [D26491,D26774]. In parallel, radio listening clubs now help to keep radio programming relevant, engaging, demand driven [D26484].",https://aiccra.marlo.cgiar.org/projects/AICCRA/contributionCrp.do?projectOutcomeID=32955&edit=true&phaseID=425

Therefore, in addition to deploying CIS-CSA innovations, institutional innovations  were also deployed to reach indirect beneficiaries with AICCRA's climate innovations. 

First,  AICCRA built the capacities of agriculture extension agents (AEAs) on CIS-CSA innovations. These AEAs were connected to the Ghana Ag-Innovation Data Hub where videos on AICCRA CIS-CSA innovations are available through an extension portal. These officers pushed these content to their network of farmers thereby reaching indirect beneficiaries. 

Second, through technical collaboration with the Food Systems Resilience Programme (FSRP), AICCRA’s CIS-CSA innovations were integrated into FSRPs innovations. Some farmers who benefitted from the FSRP thereby accessed AICCRA innovations indirectly. 

Third, AICCRA’s digital scaling partners- Farmerline, Syecomp and Esoko- integrated AICCRA CIS-CSA innovations into their technical content for routine dissemination. This content was disseminated to many farmers without AICCRA funds through their call centres, helplines, and USSD platforms. 

Fourth, AICCRA CIS-CSA innovations have been integrated into Farm Radio International's (FRI) radio extension programmes. FRI partner stations for instance, broadcast the seasonal forescast and associated agro-advisories. Media personnel trained by AICCRA also share seasonal forecast and nowcast routinely.",https://aiccra.marlo.cgiar.org/projects/AICCRA/contributionCrp.do?projectOutcomeID=40740&edit=true&phaseID=425

Discussions with country agdata hubs on how they plan to target gender and social inclusion will commence in 2024, building on the guidance report on Integrating Gender and Social Inclusion into AgData Hubs that will be produced in 2023. This may include inclusion of data or climate information that is targetted to women and youth's production activities;  consultation with different groups on type and format of information dissemination;  choice of communication channels to reach different groups, etc.  The expectation is that it may take 1-2 years to implement and test integration approaches and data generation.  Discussions are projected to be held with Senegal, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zambia agdata hubs.","A presentation was made to country clusters on integrating GSI into AgData Hubs (D26793), based on the guidance document Integrating GSI into Ag-Data Hubs (D26155), jointly developed with Theme 4. Further work on assessing integration into national AgData Hubs is planned for 2025 in collaboration with Theme 4.  
Theme 3 collaborated with Senegal on D25953, Implementation framework to conceptualize and develop national scale AgDataHubs to operationalize CIS within agriculture.",https://aiccra.marlo.cgiar.org/projects/AICCRA/contributionCrp.do?projectOutcomeID=37512&edit=true&phaseID=425

Theme 3 will contribute to at least two internal World Bank capacity development events on gender-responsive CSA:  1) Gender-responsive CSA technologies;  and 2) Gender-responsive climate finance.

Due to funding constraints, the second Women's Leadership workshop will be organized by CORAF.","The main activities here were the GSI Webinars organized with AICCRA focal points to share experience and lessons learned; and knowledge exchange with CORAF and the gender focal points for the West Africa FSRPs.
Theme 3 also contributed to the Theme 2 event on Integrating Early Warning Systems and Climate-Smart Agriculture to Build Resilient Communities.",https://aiccra.marlo.cgiar.org/projects/AICCRA/contributionCrp.do?projectOutcomeID=37136&edit=true&phaseID=425

- Participation and inputs to the gender submissions at preSB and/or preCOP AGNES meetings based on gender and climate hotspot mapping and the collaboration with UN Women on the global gender and climate policy scorecard.
– Gender and climate hotspot mapping is expected to result in policy decisions and prioritization of actions in 1-2 countries.","AICCRA participated in the preSB AGNES gender session, April 2024.  One result was a submission by Kenya to the UNFCCC on Progress, Challenges, Gaps and Priorities in Implementing the Gender Action Plan (May 2024).  AICCRA had input on some of the issues highlighted, and several references were made in the Submission to the support received from the CGIAR AICCRA and the Gender Impact Platform (D26475). 

Two policy briefs on Gender and Climate Hotspot Mapping were published, by the Government of Kenya and the Republic of Uganda.  The AICCRA logo is on both briefs, and references were made on the web page and in the brief to support by AICCRA. 

In December 2024 USAID issued a formal response to the BIFAD report, Operationalizing USAID’s Climate Strategy to Achieve Transformative Adaptation and Mitigation in Agricultural and Food Systems  (D26147), noting its intention to ""embrace the opportunities presented by these recommendations"", as part of its commitment to mobilize $150 billion in public and private finance for climate by 2030, for specific activities under the Leverage Point on Empower Women, Youth, and Other Underrepresented Groups where Theme 3 played a major role.",https://aiccra.marlo.cgiar.org/projects/AICCRA/contributionCrp.do?projectOutcomeID=37430&edit=true&phaseID=425

Theme 3 will provide information on gender smart agriculture to CORAF and the gender focal points for the West Africa FSRPs.

We will collaborate with Senegal to integrate gender and social inclusion into the Senegal Ag-Data Hub; and contribute to training material on gender-sensitive CIS.","Although there were some delays due to budget uncertainty, implementation of the joint Plan of Action with CORAF was continued with a joint AICCRA-CORAF-FSRP webinar on Integrating gender and social inclusion in climate-smart innovations, where experience of different countries in the programs was discussed and knowledge exchanged.  A joint info-note was also produced (D26812). 

Two policy briefs on the Gender and Climate Hotspot Mapping for Uganda and Kenya were published with AGNES and the relevant governments, in 2024.  Detailed Gender and Climate Hotspot mapping reports were finalized for Botswana, Kenya and Uganda and are currently in process of review by the respective governments.  AICCRA provided the services of the lead on the project, Patricia Bamanyaki, and contributed to the reports and policy briefs.  The AICCRA logo is on all these publications.    AICCRA also contributed to the final reports for the three countries that are currently under review by the country Ministries of Environment.

Following on the contributions made by Theme 3 to the UN Women report: Feminist Climate Justice: A Framework for Action (D26146), Theme 3 made inputs to the IUCN -UN Women Global Scorecard on Gender and Climate Policy (D25714) that was disseminated to governments at COP29.",https://aiccra.marlo.cgiar.org/projects/AICCRA/contributionCrp.do?projectOutcomeID=41076&edit=true&phaseID=425
